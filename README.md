## 🛠️ **Development & Compilation**

### 🏗️ **Build Environment**
APRSdroid is crafted in **Scala** using the [gradle-android-scala-plugin](https://github.com/AllBus/scala-plugin). While the compilation process is robust, please note:
- ⏱️ Full builds take approximately **3 minutes**
- 🔄 Incremental builds may occasionally produce non-functional APKs
- 🗺️ **Google Maps API key required** for map functionality

### 📋 **Prerequisites**
- ☕ **Java 8 JDK**
- 🐙 **Git** for version control
- 🗺️ **Google Maps API Key** ([Get yours here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/start)) - *Optional, only if you want Google Maps support*

### 🗝️ **Important Notice: Google Maps**
> ⚠️ **This enhanced fork does NOT include the Google Maps API** for improved privacy and reduced dependencies. The app uses offline mapping solutions (MBTiles and MapsForge) instead. If you require Google Maps functionality, you can build the app from source and add your own API key following the build instructions below.
